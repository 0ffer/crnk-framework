<h4>More flexible EntityManager setup with JPA module</h4>

JpaModule.createServerModule(...) comes with a new flavor that allows to pass the EntityManager
as java.util.Supplier. Every time a repository makes use of the EntityManager, the supplier is called and must
return an instance. The supplier together with the existing TransactionRunner
allows for custom JPA setups and transaction handling.
