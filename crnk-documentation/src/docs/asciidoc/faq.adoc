How to do Cors with Crnk?::
  In most (if not all) cases Cors should be setup in the underlying
  integration, like with the Servlet-API or as JAX-RS filter and
  not within Crnk itself. This allows to make use of the native
  Cors mechanisms of an integration and to share Cors handling with
  the other parts of the application.

Is Swagger supported by Crnk?::
  Have a look at http://www.crnk.io/related/.
