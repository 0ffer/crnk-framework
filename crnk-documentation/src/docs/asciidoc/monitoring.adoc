## Tracing with Zipkin/Brave

A `BraveClientModule` and `BraveServletModule` provided by `io.crnk:crnk-monitor-brave4` provides
integration into Zipkin/Brave to implement tracing for your repositories.  The module is applicable to
both a Crnk client or server.

The Crnk client can make use of either HttpClient or OkHttp to issue HTTP requests.
Accordingly, a matching brave integration must be added to the classpath:

* `io.zipkin.brave:brave-instrumentation-okhttp3`
* `io.zipkin.brave:brave-instrumentation-httpclient`

The `BraveClientModule` then takes care of the integration and will create a client span
for each request.

On the server-side, `BraveServletModule` creates a local span for each accessed repository.
Every request triggers one or more repository accesses (depending on whether
relations are included). Note however that `BraveServletModule` does not setup tracing
for incoming requests. That is the purpose of the JAX-RS/servlet integration of Brave.

Have a look at the Spring boot example application to see the `BraveServletModule` in use
together with a log reporter writing the output to console.

NOTE: `io.crnk:crnk-brave` is deprecated and makes use of the Brave 3.x API.
